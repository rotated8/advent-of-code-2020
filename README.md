The first time I commit something (inital commit notwithstanding) should be the way it was when I first got the
correct answer. I may go on from there to refine something, but it's not guaranteed.

I'm pushing myself a bit with some of the answers, streching at my understanding, so you may find contortions
there as I work out my idea.

First pass will be in Python, and I'd like to go back and try again with Rust.
